# Code Refactor Starter Code - Week-1-Challenge
## HTML file
The code needed semantic tags in the html file so I changed all of the div tags for better tags such as: 
* Header
* main
* section
* aside
* footer
The nav link for the first section was not working because it was missing and id. 

## CSS file
The code in the CSS file was repetitive at some parts. The main section with the 3 subsections could be summarized with
one selector instead of 3 separate classes. I also changed the image of the digital marketing meeting to appear in the HTML file instead of the CSS file so I could add the alt attribute. 

- [ x ] find semantic HTML elements
- [ x ] elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- [ x ] find accessible alt attributes
- [ x ] heading attributes fall in sequential order
- [ x ] the title element has descriptive title
